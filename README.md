# Vimposer

Vimposer is a hackable, keyboard-controlled terminal MIDI editor. Essentially, its goal is to be Vim, but for music.

This repository is a demo version - it will require much refactoring to perform at an adequate speed, but it is usable.

## Installation
```
sudo apt install fluidsynth
git clone https://github.com/joeythornberry/vimposer-py
cd vimposer-py
chmod +x vimposer-py/pose
```

## Usage
```
./pose new.mid
```

## Controls (can be edited in config/config.py)
`A`,`F`,`S`,`D` : Create a new note before, after, above, or below the cursor note
`a`,`f`,`s`,`d` : Move the cursor to a different note
`h`,`l`,`j`,`k` : Move the current cursor note
`H`,`L`,`J`,`K` : Move the viewport
`i` : Make the cursor note shorter
`o` : Make the cursor note longer
`x` : Delete the cursor note

If the above commands follow a number, they will be performed that number of times: for example, `5o` will lengthen the current note by 5 divisions.

`W` : Save
`Q` : Quit (remember to save first)
`<Space>` : Start playback (remember to save first)
`<Esc>` : Stop playback and reset current command

`tn` : Create a new track
`tj`, `tk` : Change the current track
`tx` : Delete the current track

`<number>I` : Set the MIDI instrument of the current track to `<number>`
`<number>V` : Set the velocity of the current track to `<number>`
`<number>T` : Set the tempo of the MIDI file to `<number>`
